                At 22 I decided to
                change my career path and study computer science. Before even starting university, a friend of mine in
                my hometown helped me to get a job as tech support for a New York based
                company. Did that for a year and a half then, I won an internship / competition, and got my first job as
                as Junior Web Developer at DVSE.ro(they manage online commerce portals
                written in WPF and React(as well as some MVC stuff). Spent almost a year and a bit here, and then I
                joined Bosch Automotive Solutions in Cluj-Napoca, as a Software Engineer,

                development using Vue.

                After Sofvision, I got the call to come to Switzerland, and join Amaris Consulting as a Full -

                REST api's, mostly hosted and deployed across the azure platform(I am no dev-op's by any stretch of the
